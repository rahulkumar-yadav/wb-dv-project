# Website Development Project

This website features a sleek tab-switching layout for Men, Women, and Kids categories, dynamically generating product cards with real-time data from a Shopify API. The polished design, mimicked from Figma, showcases images, badges, titles, vendors, prices, and calculated discounts. Thoroughly tested for functionality and error-free performance.

## Project Overview

- **Tab Switching:** Implemented tab switching for "Men," "Women," and "Kids" categories. Clicking on a tab shows the respective product cards and hides others.

- **Product Card:**

  - Displayed product image, badge, title, vendor, price, and calculated discount (% off).
  - Added a dummy "Add to Cart" button for visual representation.

- **API Integration:**
  - Fetched product data from the [Product data API](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0564/3685/0790/files/multiProduct.json).
  - Dynamically populated product cards with API response data.
